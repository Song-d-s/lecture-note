#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ type example 1
```ts
type Nickname = string
type Health = number
type Friends = Array<string>

type Player = {
    nickname: Nickname,
    healthBar: Health,
}

const coco: Player = {
    nickname: "coco",
    healthBar: 10
}

type Food = string

const kimchi: Food = "delicious"
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ type example 2
```ts
type Team = "red" | "blue" | "yellow"
type Health = 1 | 5 | 10

type Player = {
    nickname: string,
    team: Team,
    health: Health
}

const coco: Player = {
    nickname: "coco",
    team: "yellow",
    health: 10
}
```

# *Ô∏è‚É£ Interfaces
> Interfaces specify the shape of objects (Only Purpose)
```ts
type Team = "red" | "blue" | "yellow"
type Health = 1 | 5 | 10

interface Player {  // interface
    nickname: string,
    team: Team,
    health: Health
}

const coco: Player = {
    nickname: "coco",
    team: "yellow",
    health: 10
}
```
#### üîÖ Interface example
```ts
// case 1. type
type User = {
    name: string
}

type Player = User & {
}

// case 2. interface (same with case 1 above)
interface User {
    name: string
}

interface Player extends User {
}

const coco: Player = {
    name: "coco",
}
```
### ‚≠ï Interfaces can *accumulate* properties
```ts
interface User {
  name: string
}
interface User {
  lastName: string
}
interface User {
  health: number
}

const coco: User = {
  name: "coco",
  lastName: "las",
  health: 10
}
// cannot do this with the Type
```

#### type vs. interface
- `type` is more flexible
- `interface` is more close to OOP concepts

## Review
```ts
abstract class User {
  constructor (
    protected firstName: string,
    protected lastName: string
  ) {}
  abstract sayHi(name: string): string
  abstract fullName(): string
}
 
class Player extends User {
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
  sayHi(name: string) {
    return `Hello ${name}. My name is ${this.fullName()}`
  }
}
```
> problem of using abstract class
> - An `abstract` class in TS becomes a normal class and remains in resulting JS file
> - Using `Interface` can solve this. `Interface` disappears when it is compiled into JS.
```ts
interface User {
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  sayHi(name: string): string,
  fullName(): string,
}

interface Human {
  health: number
}

class Player implements User, Human {
    constructor(
      // no private or protected allowed
        public firstName: string,
        public lastName: string,
        public health: number,
    ) {}
    fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
    sayHi(name: string) {
        return `Hello ${name}. My name is ${this.fullName()}`
    }
}
```
> - `Interface` is efficient as it does not complied into result JS file
#### `Interface` can be used as a `Type`
```ts
function makeUser(user: User){
  return "hi"
}

makeUser({
  firstName: "coco",
  lastName:"las",
  fullName: () => "xx",
  sayHi: (name) => "string"
})
```

## Recap
### ‚ùá Interface vs. Type
> - both explain the shape of an object
> - both do replace the abstract class
> - both can be implemented by a class
```ts
// type
type PlayerA = {
    name: string
}
    // extending the Type
type PlayerAA = PlayerA & {
    lastName: string
}
const playerA: PlayerAA = {
    name: "coco",
    lastName: "las"
}

// interface
interface PlayerB {
    name: string
}
interface PlayerBB extends PlayerB {
    lastName: string,
}
// interface can be accumulated
interface PlayerBB {
    health: number,
}
const playerB: PlayerBB = {
    name: "lili",
    lastName: "las",
    health: 100,
}
```

```ts
type PlayerA = {
    firstName: string
}
interface PlayerB {
    firstName: string
}

// both are very same in their usage
class UserA implements PlayerA {    // type
    constructor(
        public firstName: string
    ) {}
}

class UserB implements PlayerB {    // interface
    constructor(
        public firstName: string
    ) {}
}
```
