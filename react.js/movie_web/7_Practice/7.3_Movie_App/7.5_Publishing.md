  `npm i gh-pages`

- to compress (skip this)

- edit `package.json`

- to check where your repo is
  `git remote -v`

```js
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "predeploy": "npm run build"
  },
  ...
    ]
  },
  "homepage": "https://song-d-s.github.io/<repository name>"
}
```
